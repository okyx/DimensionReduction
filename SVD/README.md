## SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
Step of Linear Discriminant
1. Compute matrix U = X * X transpose where X is data
2. find eigenvector and eigenvalue of U 
3. sorting eigen from biggest eigen value
4. determine the num_component
5. calculate square root of ordered eigen value i will call it S
6. calculate eigen vector U with S
